# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this project was to utilize unsupervised machine learning to analyze a dataset of cryptocurrencies, discover trends, and thus, identify cryptocurrencies worth investing in.

This project involves the use of the K-Means Clustering algorithm; using the inerties and range of K values, we've determined the ideal number of clusters and provided visualizations for them.
